Oscar Backend

Oscar is a Movie domain ontology based QA chatbot.
The frontend was made in ReactJS and it communicates with a Spring (Java) backend using queries in GET requests.
The queries are processed and using the OWL API, the results are generated.
The chatbot supports basic natural language queries and the addition of new axioms while maintaining the consistency of the ontology.

The project was made as a part of the Ontology Modelling course at IIIT Delhi, under the guidance of Dr. Raghava Mutharaju.
